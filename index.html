    <h1>Rock, Paper, Scissors</h1>
    <p>Hey, thanks for stopping by my page.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Here's how you can play the game:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by activating the Chrome Developer Tools however you want. (I like the <em>shift+ctrl+j</em> shortcut)</li>
        <li>Once you're there, enter/copy + paste the following: game();</li>
        <li><em>game();</em> is what is called a <strong>function</strong>. When you enter this <em>function</em> into the console, you are also activating code written inside of the function declaration to run. Inside of the function are the key code needed to play the game!</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>
    <p>- Nathan</p>
