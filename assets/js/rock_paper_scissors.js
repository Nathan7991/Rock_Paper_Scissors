/*
How will the user give input?
◦ Use the prompt() function, and save the user’s answer to a variable. 
    ▪ That variable will store the user’s choice for each round.

• How will the computer choose a move?
◦ Using a function that generates a computer’s move using Math.floor(Math.random.()…) functions.
    ▪ If the computer generates 1, then return the string “rock”;
    ▪ If cpu generates 2, then return the string “paper”;
    ▪ If cpu generates 3, then return the string “scissors”;

• How many rounds will there be?
◦ 3 rounds.
◦ Each round will complete after the computer and user choices are compared, with the results being saved to a variable.
    ▪ “userPoints”
    ▪ “computerPoints”
        • When either the userPoints or computerPoints variable value reaches 3, then the game is over and a winner is chosen.
